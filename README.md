## RP2040 gameboy camera project - WIP

Currently only contains a simple driver for the SHARP LS013B7DH05, which I am going to play around with as a "viewfinder".

## Building, flashing

Run `source setup.sh`, then `./flash.sh`. You can run `./serial.sh` in another tab to show the log output. `./flash.sh` will wait until it sees the device (you have to press down BOOTSEL + RESET).

## MacOS eject notifications
Adafruit has a [wonderful blog](https://blog.adafruit.com/2021/05/11/how-to-tone-down-macos-big-surs-circuitpy-eject-notifications/) showing you how to tone down the annoying "disk ejected unsafely" notifications. It doesn't remove it but at least they auto-dismiss.
